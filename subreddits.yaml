    /r/boogiemusic - 80's sound, timeless groove!



    Boogie (sometimes called electro-funk or post-disco) is a genre of electronic
    dance music, that combines stylistic features of post-disco with funk, that
    first emerged in the United States during the late 1970s to mid-1980s. The
    sound of boogie defined by bridging acoustic and electronic musical
    instruments with emphasis on vocals and miscellaneous effects later evolved
    into electro and house music

    Metalcore is a subgenre of hardcore punk combining various elements of

    Metalcore is distinguished from other punk metal fusions by its emphasis on

    person who'd go to the record store and leave with 10 records they'd never
    heard of, simply because the cover was intriguing, or the artist was signed
    to a label they liked. It's a place for people who want to find new artists,
    and for those who want to expose others to great unheard artists.
